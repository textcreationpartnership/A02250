            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Etweene the Mountaines of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South, lyes the territory of <hi>Salus,</hi> a Country flouri≈øhing with excellent Townes and Ca≈øtles, and peopled with the be≈øt ≈øort of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Pea≈øants: among≈øt whom there liued not long ≈øince a Nobleman, of great hope and expectation, Lord of the Cnuntry, by name, <hi>Gualter,</hi> Marque≈ø≈øe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øs:</hi> to whom, as the gouernment a pertained by right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; ≈øo their obedience attended, by de≈øert of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thine≈ø≈øe. He was young in y√©eres, noble of lineage, and ≈øuch attractiue demeanor, that the be≈øt thought it a plea≈øure to b√©e commanded by him, and the wor≈øt grew more tractable by his good example: his delight was in hunting and hawking, and the plea≈øure of the time pre≈øent extingui≈øhed the care of the time to come; for he thought not of mariage, nor to intangle him≈øelfe with the inconueniences of a wife, till at la≈øt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb facs="tcp:19585:3"/> and Noblemen of his Country proiected the contrary, as di≈øcontented to ≈ø√©e him indi≈øpo≈øed that way, and pre≈øaging a kind of pro≈øperity to them≈øelues, if by his mariage po≈øteritie might ari≈øe to a≈ø≈øure them the better, how they might be≈øtow their obedience hereafter. Whereupon, they a≈ø≈øembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made one day among≈øt the re≈øt a determiner of their re≈øolutions, choo≈øing out for their ≈øpeaker a Noble Knight, of great authority, faire demeanor, eloquent ≈øp√©ech, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the Marque≈ø≈øe then any of the re≈øt: who, thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all their mindes, and prepared to vtter his owne minde, tooke an opportunity to acquaint the renowned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈ø≈øe with the matter.</p>
               <p>Mo≈øt Honourable Sir, the great humanity extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, &amp; of which I mo≈øt e≈øpecially haue participated, hath thus emboldened me aboue others, to make a further triall of your patience, and forbearing my rudenes; not that there is any ≈øufficiency or ≈øingularity in me aboue others: but in that h√©eretofore I haue found you ≈øo generous toward all, I make no que≈øtion to finde you as gratious toward my ≈øelfe; and in that it hath plea≈øed you to accept of our loue, wee are proud againe to be vnder your obedience: wherein we ≈øhall reioice the more, if you now accord to our reque≈øt the ≈øooner, which is, to marry without delay. The time pa≈ø≈øeth, and will not be recalled: your youth intreats it, and mu≈øt not be demed: your countrey importunes it, and would not bee oppo≈øed: your neighbours de≈øire it, and hope to bee ≈øatisfied: and all ≈øorts reque≈øt it, and wi≈øh it for your honour. For when age approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, death attends it at the h√©eles, &amp; no man can tell when, or how it will fall vpon him. Therefore wee humbly reque≈øt you to accept our ≈øupplications, and accord to this importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that we may prouide by your appointment, a lady wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your honour and our ≈øubiection. In this wee are the more ≈øuppliant, becau≈øe it will rebound ≈øo much to the good of your countrey, and the enlarging your renowne: for if it ≈øhould ≈øo fall out (which God forbid) that you die without i≈ø≈øue, we may lament the lo≈ø≈øe of our lord, but not redre≈ø≈øe the complaints of the people: we ≈øhall want you that was al our
<pb facs="tcp:19585:3"/> comfort, but are ≈øure of di≈øtre≈ø≈øe to our euerla≈øting trouble. If then you either loue your ≈øelfe, or pity vs, frame a heart to this impre≈ø≈øion, and leaue not vs to further feare and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
               <p>When the noble lord had thus apprehended the petition of his louing ≈øubiects, he re≈øolued to an≈øwer them as gratiou≈øly as they had propounded the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe with regard of duty, and ≈øo replied: My deare≈øt friends, you haue vrged mee to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which as yet I haue beene a mere ≈øtranger: for by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I delight in liberty, and by cu≈øtome continued my plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures; both which mu≈øt needs bee curbed by mariage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained by taking a wife: notwith≈øtanding, I ca≈øt awaie all doubts, to plea≈øure you; and will thinke of no incombrances ≈øo you be ≈øatisfied. For though mariage hath many difficulties attending; e≈øpecially, the feare of legitimation in our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ≈øu≈øpicion of that honour which lies on our wiues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øty, yet all ≈øhall bee ouercomne with this re≈øolution, that I ≈øhall plea≈øe you in the ≈øame: for I am re≈øolued, if anie good come for mans contentment by marriage, it is from God; to whom I ≈øubmit this cau≈øe, and pray for the good ≈øucce≈øse of your wi≈øhes, that I may liue to maintaine your peace, as well as my owne plea≈øure: and look wherein my contentment ≈øhall enlarge mine honour, your welfare ≈øhall be re≈øpected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue my life; ≈øo that (beleeue it) I will ≈øatisfie your demands, and apply my ≈øelfe to the purpo≈øe. Only one thing I reque≈øt at your hands, to take in worth my choice, and neither in≈øult if ≈øhe be a prince≈ø≈øe of greatnes, nor repine if ≈øhe be of meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate: but loue her becau≈øe I haue loued you, and regard her how≈øoeuer, in that ≈øhe is my wife; neither being curious nor inqui≈øitiue whom I will chu≈øe, nor di≈øaffected when it is pa≈øt remedy.</p>
               <p>When the company had heard him out, and found him ≈øo willing to their ≈øatisfaction, they gaue him thankes with one heart for his kinde admi≈ø≈øion, and an≈øwered with one tongue, he ≈øhould not finde them repugnant, but they would honor his wife as the prince≈ø≈øe of the world, and be morigerous to him as the Commander of their ≈øoules. Thus did this new report
<pb facs="tcp:19585:4"/> (like a me≈ø≈øenger of glad tidings) fill all the <hi>Marqui≈øate</hi> with ioy, and the palace with delight, when they vnder≈øtood their lord would marry, and in a manner heard the time appointed: for pre≈øently it was proclaimed through the Countrey, and a day a≈ø≈øigned for all commers to come to the Court. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles prepared them≈øelues in the be≈øt manner: the Ladies ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no co≈øt, either for ornaments of their bodies, or ≈øetting out their beauties: the Gentles flocked to plea≈øe their lord, and were braue to ≈øet out their owne greatnes: the Citizens were rich in their neatnes, and hand≈øome in their attire: the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were formall in their ≈øhowes, and ≈øumptuous in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants: the Countryman had his variety, and the verie Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant his brauery; in a word, al ≈øorts gloried in the hope of that fe≈øtiuall, and euery mans expectation attended the day of the triumph. For neuer was ≈øuch a preparation in <hi>Salu≈øs</hi> before, nor ≈øuch a confluence of people ≈øeene in that countrey: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the nouelty, many forraine Princes came to celebrate this mariage, and to ≈øhew their owne greatnes. <hi>Sauoy</hi> was neare, and ≈øent ≈øome from her ≈ønowie hills: <hi>France</hi> as neare, and ≈øent others from her fruitfull vines: <hi>Italy</hi> not far off, and ≈øent many from her plea≈øant fields: and the Ilands round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout kept none at home that would come. Thus were his kinred inuited, ≈øtrangers admitted, his owne people entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all ≈øorts welcommed: but as yet no bride was ≈øeene, no woman named, no lady de≈øigned, no maid publi≈øhed, no wife knowne: onely the preparation was much, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation greater.</p>
               <p>All this while the <hi>Marque≈ø≈øe</hi> continued his hunting; and as he had accu≈øtomed, re≈øorted much to a poore country village not farre from <hi>Salu≈ø≈øe;</hi> where there dwelt as poore a countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, named <hi>Ianicole,</hi> ouerworne in yeares, and ouercomne with di≈øtre≈ø≈øe. But as it happens many times, that inward graces doe moderate outward di≈øcommodities, and that God ≈øea≈øoneth pouerty with contentment and their ≈øufficient ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation: ≈øo had this poore man all his de≈øerts ≈øupplied in the admirable comfort of one onely daughter; ≈øo compo≈øed, as if Nature determined a worke of o≈øtentation. For ≈øuch was her
<pb facs="tcp:19585:4"/> beauty in appearance, and vertue in operation, that it put iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men to an exta≈øie in the choi≈øe by compari≈øon: but both vnited did h√©ere grace each other; and when they pretended an action, it was all to go forward to perfection. And whereas in others this temporary ble≈ø≈øing gaue wings to de≈øire, to bee ≈øeene and knowne abroad; in her tho≈øe innated vertues allaied the heat of all manner of pa≈ø≈øion, and breakings out of frailty. The viands they had were but meane, and the diet they kept was to ≈øatisfie nature: the time was ouer-ruled by their ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks, and the ceremonies they v≈øed were thanks to God, &amp; moderation in their repa≈øts. The vten≈øiles of the hou≈øe were homely, yet hand≈øome in regard of their cleanline≈ø≈øe: that bed which they had the ould man lay in, and the ≈øw√©et daug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

               <p>WHen all things were extended to this glorious ≈øhew, the Marque≈ø≈øe (as if he went to fetch his wife indeed) tooke with him a great company of Earls, Lords, Knights, Squires and Gentlemen, Ladies and attendants; and went from the Palace into the Country toward <hi>Ianicolas</hi> hou≈øe; where the faire mayd <hi>Gri≈øel</hi> knowing nothing of that which hapned, nor once dreaming of that which was to come, had made her hou≈øe and ≈øelfe ≈øomwhat hand≈øome, determining (with the re≈øt of her neighbor Virgins) to ≈ø√©e this ≈øolemnity: at which in≈øtant arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Marque≈ø≈øe with all his gracious company, meeting with <hi>Gri≈øel,</hi> as ≈øh√©e was carrying two pitchers of water to her poor fathers hou≈øe.

<pb facs="tcp:19585:5"/> Goe then ≈øaid hee, and tell him I would ≈øpeak with him. So the poore old man (made the poorer by this a≈øtoni≈øhment) came forth to the Lord ≈øomewhat appauled: till the <hi>Marque≈ø≈øe,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him by the hand, with an extraordinary chearefulne≈ø≈øe, ≈øaid, that he had a ≈øecret to impart vnto him; and ≈øo ≈øeque≈øtring him from the company, ≈øpake the≈øe words: <hi>Ianicola,</hi> I know, that you alwaies loued me, and am re≈øolued, that you doe not now hate me: you haue beene glad when I haue been plea≈øed; and will not now bee ≈øorrowfull, if I bee ≈øatisfied: nay, I am ≈øure, if it lie in your power, you will further my delight, and not bee a contrary to my reque≈øt. For I intend to begge your daughter for my wife, and bee your ≈øonne in lawe for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement. What ≈øaie≈øt thou man? wilt thou accept mee for a friend, as I haue appointed thee for a father? The poore ould man was ≈øo a≈øtoni≈øhed, that he could not looke vp for teares, nor ≈øpeake a word for ioy: but when the exta≈øie had end, hee thus faintly replied; My gracious Soueraigne, you are my lord, and therefore I mu≈øt accord to your will; but you are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, and therefore I pre≈øume on your vertue: take her a Gods name, and make mee a glad father; and let that God, which rai≈øeth the humble and m√©ek, make her a befitting wife, and fruitfull mother. Why then, replied the <hi>Marque≈ø≈øe,</hi> let vs enter your hou≈øe: for I mu≈øt aske her a que≈øtion before you.

               <p>My gracious lord, I am not ignorant of your greatne≈ø≈øe, and know mine owne ba≈øene≈ø≈øe; there is no worth in me to be your ≈øeruant, therefore there can be no de≈øert to be your wife: notwith≈øtanding, becau≈øe God will be the Author of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous accidents, I y√©eld to your plea≈øure, and prai≈øe him for the fortune, onely this I will be bold to ≈øay, That your will ≈øhall ≈øhall be my delight, and death ≈øhall be more welcome vnto m√©e, then a word of di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt you.</p>

               <p>Although, <hi>Gri≈øel,</hi> this your pre≈øent Fortune hath made you forget your former e≈øtate, and that the iollity of your life ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwayeth the remembrance of your birth; yet, neither is it ≈øo with me, nor my Nobles: For I haue ≈øome occa≈øion of di≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting, and they great cau≈øe of repining, in that they mu≈øt be ≈øubiect to one ≈øo ba≈øe, and haue ≈øtill before their eyes our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ≈øuch low degr√©e; ≈øo that though (for my ≈øake) they make good ≈øemblance of the pre≈øent, yet are they re≈øolued neuer to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <p>The Lady hearing this ≈øorrowfull preamble, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the Marque≈ø≈øe re≈øolution, to her griefe (although eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word might haue b√©ene as arrowes in her ≈øides) yet admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the temptation, and di≈øputing with her ≈øelfe to what end the vertues of Patience, Mode≈øty, Forbearance, Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Magnanimity were ordained, if they had not ≈øubiects to worke vpon, and obiects to looke after; thus replyed:</p>
               <p>My lord, you are my Soueraigne, and all earthly plea≈øures and contentments of my life come from you, as the fountaine of my happine≈ø≈øe; and therefore plea≈øe your ≈øelfe, and (bel√©eue it) it is my plea≈øure that you are plea≈øed: as for the child, it is the gift of God and yours.

               <p>SOme do≈øen y√©eres were pa≈ø≈øed, ≈øince the Marque≈ø≈øe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu≈øs</hi> had ≈øent his daughter to <hi>Bologna</hi> to his ≈øi≈øter (as you haue heard) who was by this time growne to that beautie, comeline≈ø≈øe and perfection, that her fame bu≈øied all <hi>Europe;</hi> and the lady <hi>Gri≈øel,</hi> her Mother, was made acquainted with her excellency; whereupon, he very ≈øtrangely ≈øent to <hi>Rome,</hi> by a Me≈ø≈øenger of tru≈øt, for counterfait letters to marrie his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, and to bee di≈øpen≈øed from his fir≈øt wife. Which was ≈øo effectually di≈øpatched, that the Me≈ø≈øenger ≈øoone returned with the approbation of his reque≈øt, and hee him≈øelfe had many allegations in readine≈ø≈øe to excu≈øe the matter, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the good of the Countrie, and the continuall de≈øire of his people for the alteration; which although it was far from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, becau≈øe they pitied their ladies di≈øtre≈ø≈øe, and rather repined again≈øt their lords vncon≈øtancy: yet it ≈øerued his turne for the time, and he thereupon erected the frame of this ≈øecond marriage. By this time is the faire <hi>Gri≈øel</hi> acquainted with the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and troubled at the misfortune; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many times plaied the wanton with affliction, ≈øhe re≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled her≈øelfe to endure what≈øoeuer ≈øhould be impo≈øed: ≈øo that when ≈øhe came to the proofe ind√©ed, nothing affronted her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy, nor humbled her lower, then her own vertue had taught her the way.</p>
               <p>In the meane while the Marque≈ø≈øe had vnder hand ≈øent to the Count of <hi>Paniche,</hi> and his ≈øi≈øter, to bring him his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with all the pompe and glory they could prepare; with caution, not to di≈øcouer their names and to be at a day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Salu≈øs:</hi> ≈øo that it pa≈ø≈øed for currant all ouer the Country, that a lady, a yong, braue, and gallant lady, of great lineage,
<pb facs="tcp:19585:13"/> and greater worth, of high renown and mighty affinity, was comming into <hi>Salu≈øs</hi> to be e≈øpou≈øed to the Marque≈ø≈øe, and that they were already come out of <hi>Bologna de Grace,</hi> a whole dayes iourney forward, with ≈øuch a troope and company, that it was a ≈øhew of magnificence, and a ≈øpectacle of delight. For among≈øt the re≈øt, there was a young lord, not fully eight y√©ere old, who≈øe brauery and gallantne≈ø≈øe drew all mens eyes with admiration toward him, had not the lady diuided the gazing, and ≈øhared with their opinion. For, be≈øides her riches and outward ornaments, her youth (as not fully thirt√©ene) and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right comeline≈ø≈øe, her bewty and gracious behauiour, ≈øhe was of extraordinary ≈øtature and maie≈øtike pre≈øence.</p>
               <p>The≈øe things thus di≈øpo≈øed and hand≈øomly carried, the Marque≈ø≈øe tooke an opportunity thus to ≈øpeak to the di≈øcon≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Gri≈øel</hi> before all his people: In times pa≈øt I confe≈ø≈øe you de≈øerued my loue, and notwith≈øtanding the di≈øparity betw√©ene vs, I thought it well be≈øtowed vpon you; nay, I cannot now impute any ill de≈øert vnto you: notwith≈øtanding, for ≈øome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons to my ≈øelfe be≈øt knowne, of which I haue made the holy Father acquainted, I am re≈øolued to take another wife; who, as you heare, is on the way hitherward already: therefore I would adui≈øe you to retire to your fathers cotage, till you heare further from me.</p>
               <p>Alas my lord, replied the ≈øw√©et ≈øoule, I euer di≈øputed the matter with rea≈øon, that there was no equality betw√©ene ≈øo great magnificence and my humiliation, and in the greate≈øt a≈ø≈øurance of my pro≈øperity, replaced my ≈øelfe a va≈ø≈øaile &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid; proud of nothing but my owne readine≈ø≈øe to be at your command, &amp; your willingnes to imploy mee in your affaires; ≈øo that I take God to my witnes, I ≈øcarce tru≈øted my ≈øelfe with the name of a wife, when I was in the be≈øt a≈ø≈øurance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I mu≈øt acknowledge, what you haue heeretofore vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafed, as a part of great bounty, and the very fruits of your generou≈ønes. As for returning to my poore Fathers hou≈øe, I am mo≈øt willing; and there as you plea≈øe, like a forlorne wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow wil ≈øpend the re≈øt of my dayes: yet remember I was your wife, e≈øpou≈øed orderly, and you haue had children by mee, ≈øo
<pb facs="tcp:19585:13"/> that if I there dye, I mu≈øt yet dye the widdow of ≈øuch a lord, and for honors ≈øake be ≈øo reputed.

As for my Dowry I brought, I brought only my ≈øelfe, and will haue no more backe againe, which was, faith, loue, reuerence, pouerty and virginity: For, as I came naked from my fathers hou≈øe, I am contented to returne ≈øo againe.

               <p>Did I ≈øay before, they beganne to w√©ep? I can a≈ø≈øure you, when ≈øh√©e had done, they roared out-right; yea, the Marque≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe ≈øhed ≈øo many teares, that he was faine to retire; and commanded the ≈ømock ≈øh√©e had begged to be ≈øent vnto her, that ≈øh√©e might pro≈øecute the enterpri≈øe, and he determine his bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, as he had con≈øtantly proiected.</p>

               <p>After the Marque≈ø≈øe was re≈øolued to the la≈øt Act of her try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and had ≈øent her the ≈ømocke ≈øh√©e demanded, among≈øt all the Lords, Knights, Ladies and other company, ≈øhe pre≈øently di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed her ≈øelfe, and went ≈øo accompanied, from the Palace, to her fathers Cottage, who as you haue heard (for diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons) was only kept from want, but neuer aduanced out of the ≈øame.</p>
               <p>The company could not choo≈øe but w√©epe and deplore the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Fortune: ≈øhe could not choo≈øe but ≈ømile, that her vertue was predominant ouer pa≈ø≈øion: they exclaimed again≈øt the cruelty of her lord, ≈øhe di≈øclaimed the lea≈øt inuentiue again≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:19585:15"/> him: they wondred at ≈øo great vertue and patience, ≈øhe re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them they were exerci≈øes befitting a mode≈øt woman; they followed her with true loue and de≈øires to doe her good, ≈øhee thanked them with a true heart, and reque≈øt to de≈øi≈øt from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further deploring of her e≈øtate.</p>
               <p>By this time they approched the hou≈øe, and the poore old man <hi>Ianicola</hi> acquainted with the hurliburly, came out to ≈ø√©e what the matter was. And finding it was his daughter in her ≈ømocke, and in ≈øo honourable a company, bemoaning het di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈ø≈øe, ≈øhe quickly left them all vn≈øpoke vnto, and ran in for tho≈øe poore robes, which were formerly left in the hou≈øe: with which hee quickly arayed her, and told her before them all, that now ≈øh√©e was in her right element; and ki≈ø≈øing her, bad her welcom. The company was as much a≈øtoni≈øhed at his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as at her con≈øtancie, wondring how nature could bee ≈øo re≈øtrained from pa≈ø≈øion, and that any woman had ≈øuch grace to be ≈øo gracious; in which amaze, not without ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of fortune, and their Lords cruelty, they left her to the pouerty of the Cell, and returnrd them≈øelues to the glory of the Palace: where they recounted to the Marque≈ø≈øe, the ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and the manner of the accidents, and ≈øhee continued in her fir≈øt moderation and indefatigable patience; the poore Father onely laughing to ≈øcorne the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeries and ≈øodaine mutabilitie of humane condition, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting his daughter in her well-begun cour≈øes of mode≈øty and repo≈øedne≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>Not long after, approched the Counte≈ø≈øe of <hi>Paniche,</hi> or if you will Duche≈ø≈øe of <hi>Bologna,</hi> with her glorious company and beautifull lady, ≈øending word before hand, that ≈øhe would be at <hi>Salu≈øs</hi> ≈øuch a day; whereupon the Marque≈ø≈øe ≈øent a troope to welcome her, and prepared the Court for her intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the bruit of which yet had not ≈øo equall a pa≈ø≈øage, but diuers contrarious opinions thus bandied them≈øelues; ≈øome ab≈øolutely condemned the incon≈øtancie of the lord, others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the mi≈øfortune of the lady; ≈øome repined to ≈ø√©e a man ≈øo cruell again≈øt ≈øo great worthine≈ø≈øe, others exemplified her prai≈øes to all eternitie; ≈øome were tran≈øported with the
<pb facs="tcp:19585:15"/> gallant youth and comeline≈ø≈øe of this now bewtifull Virgine, others pre≈øumed to parallel the faire <hi>Gri≈øel,</hi> but that ≈øh√©e had ≈øtepped a little before her in yeeres: ≈øome harped vpon her great Nobilitie and high Lineage, others compared the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wifes vertue and true wi≈øedome; ≈øome excu≈øed their lord, by the loue to his Country, others excu≈øed the lady, by the nature of the aduer≈øitie, vntill the approach of the faire Virgine and the young Noble man in her company, extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed all former conceits, and ≈øet them to a new worke, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this ≈øpectacle, wherein the young lady, and her braue brother had ≈øuch preeminence: nor knew the Earle of <hi>Paniche</hi> him≈øelfe or any of the company on either ≈øide, that they were his owne children by <hi>Gri≈øel,</hi> but meerely ≈øtrangers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned for this new mariage. So the great Marque≈ø≈øe made good ≈øemblance, and with his accu≈øtomed courtline≈ø≈øe welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them all to the Palace.</p>
               <p>The very next morning (or, if you will, the day before) he ≈øent a Me≈ø≈øenger for <hi>Gri≈øel</hi> to come vnto him in the very ≈øame manner as ≈øhee was, who protracted no time, but pre≈øently attended her lord: at her approach he was ≈øomewhat appalled: but yet ≈øetting (as wee ≈øay) the be≈øt foot forward, hee thus proc√©eded.</p>
               <p>The lady <hi>(Gri≈øel)</hi> with whom I mu≈øt marrie, will bee here to morrow by this time, and the fea≈øt is prepared according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; now becau≈øe there is none ≈øo well acquainted with the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of my Palace, and di≈øpo≈øition of my ≈øelfe as you, I would haue you, for all this ba≈øe attire, addre≈ø≈øe your wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the ordering of the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, appointing ≈øuch officers as is befitting, and di≈øpo≈øing the roomes, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gr√©es and e≈øtate of the per≈øons: let the lady haue the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the mariage chamber, and the young lord the plea≈øure of the gallery, let the re≈øt be lodged in the Courts, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øort vpon the ≈øides of the garden: let the viands bee plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and the ceremonies maintained; let the ≈øhowes bee ≈øumptuous, and the pa≈øtimes as it becommeth: in a word, let nothing be wanting, which may ≈øet forth my honour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the people.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19585:16"/>
               <p>My Lord, ≈øaith ≈øh√©e, I euer tould you, I took plea≈øure in nothing but your contentment, and what≈øoeuer might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your delight, therein con≈øi≈øted my ioy and happine≈ø≈øe: therefore make no que≈øtion of my diligence and duty in this, or any other thing which it ≈øhal plea≈øe you to impo≈øe vpon me: and ≈øo like a poore ≈øeruant ≈øh√©e pre≈øently addre≈ø≈øed her≈øelfe to the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of the hou≈øe; performing ell things with ≈øuch a quicknes and grace, that each one wondred at her goodne≈ø≈øe and faire demeanour, and many murmured to ≈ø√©e her put to ≈øuch a triall. But the day of entertainement is now comne: and when the faire lady approached, her very pre≈øence had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt extingui≈øhed the impre≈ø≈øion of <hi>Gri≈øels</hi> worthine≈ø≈øe: for ≈øome vncon≈øtant humouri≈øts gaue way to the alteration, not blaming the Marque≈ø≈øe for ≈øuch a change. But when the ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were made acquainted with the Fortune of <hi>Gri≈øel;</hi> and ≈øaw her faire demeanour, they could not but e≈øt√©eme her a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great vertue and honour; being more ama≈øed at her patience, then at the mutability of mans condition; till at la≈øt ≈øh√©e approached the lady, and taking her by the hand, v≈øed this ≈øp√©ech.</p>
               <p>Lady, if it were not his plea≈øure that may command to bid you welcome, yet me thinks there is a kinde of ouer-ruling grace from nature in you, that mu≈øt exact a re≈øpect vnto you. And as for you, yong lord, I can ≈øay no more, but if I might haue my de≈øires ≈øatisfied in this world, they ≈øhould be imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wi≈øh you well, and to endeauour all things for your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement ind√©ed.

And ≈øo ≈øh√©e conducted them to their ≈øeuerall chambers, where they repo≈øed them≈øelues awhile, till the time of dinner inuited them to repa≈øt. When all things were prepared, and the ≈øolemnity of placing the gue≈øts fini≈øhed, the Marque≈ø≈øe ≈øent for <hi>Gri≈øel;</hi> and ri≈øing on his f√©et, took her by the hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all, erecting his body, and elating his vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               <p>My lord, replied ≈øhe before them all, wherein as a woman I might be faulty, I will not now di≈øpute: but becau≈øe I am your wife, and haue deuoted my ≈øelfe to obedience, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued to delight in nothing but your plea≈øure: ≈øo that if this match be de≈øigned for your good, and determined by your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, I am much ≈øatisfied, and more then much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

               <p>AFter a little reducement of his pa≈ø≈øion, and that time, and further meditation had di≈øpo≈øed his ≈øen≈øes to their perfect e≈øtate, the Marque≈ø≈øe graciou≈øly an≈øwered:</p>
               <p>Thou wonder of women, and Champion of true vertue; I am a≈øhamed of my imperfections, and tyred with abu≈øing thee, I haue tryed th√©e beyond rea≈øon, and thou ha≈øt forborne mee

Oh, 'tis a plea≈øure to be acquainted with thy worth, and to come n√©ere thy goodnes maketh a man better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe. For without controuer≈øie, except thou had≈øt b√©ene ≈øent from aboue, then could≈øt neuer haue acted a godde≈ø≈øes part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe: and therefore ≈ø√©eing I haue v≈øed th√©e ≈øo vnkindly h√©er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, I prote≈øt neuer to di≈øquiet th√©e h√©ereafter: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my cruelty extended again≈øt th√©e in bereauing th√©e of thy children, my loue ≈øhall now make amends in re≈øtoring thy daughter.

This deuice of the Marque≈ø≈øes, of ki≈ø≈øing her ≈øo louingly, and ≈øetting her downe by him ≈øo di≈øcr√©etly, did much good. For the company had time to di≈øpute of the miracle, and the yong lady rea≈øon to prepare her obedience; which, no ≈øooner was the dinner fini≈øhed, but ≈øh√©e as ≈øoone performed, nothing thought vpon but ioy at the matter, and wonder at the accident: euery one plea≈øed to ≈ø√©e ≈øuch a vnity of goodnes, and all delighted to haue a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe ≈øo well concluded. But ≈ø√©eing time had vncla≈øped a booke of ≈øuch iollity, there was now no further di≈øputing: For the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies flocked about her to attend her into the chamber; where the yong Prince≈ø≈øe her daughter was as ready as the be≈øt to apparell her: ≈øo that when ≈øh√©e came among≈øt them againe, ≈øhe ≈øhined like the Sun after a tempe≈øt, and ≈øeemed more glorious, becau≈øe her continued mode≈øty kept her from all in≈øulting and vaine glorious brauery.</p>
